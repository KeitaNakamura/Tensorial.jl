# Tensorial

## Introduction

Tensorial provides useful tensor operations (e.g., contraction; tensor product, `âŠ—`; `inv`; etc.) written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).
The library supports arbitrary size of non-symmetric and symmetric tensors, where symmetries should be specified to avoid wasteful duplicate computations.
The way to give a size of the tensor is similar to [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl), and symmetries of tensors can be specified by using `@Symmetry`.
For example, symmetric fourth-order tensor (symmetrizing tensor) is represented in this library as `Tensor{Tuple{@Symmetry{3,3}, @Symmetry{3,3}}}`.
Einstein summation macro and automatic differentiation functions are also provided.
